This ratio is multiplied by 100 to provide numbers in percent (%). The measurements are taken at a height of 2 metres above the ground surface. The instrument is a capacitive thin-film device. It measures the flow of electricity across two electrodes separated by a polymer film. The capacitance of the film is converted to relative humidity by a calibration equation. The values are averaged over 5-minute periods, obtained by selecting \"sub-hourly\" aggregation period. Other aggregation periods (\"hourly\", \"daily\") are also available, in which case the results are based on further averages of the 5-minute data. A quality flag is also available for this variable."

          "description": "This parameter is the average of all sub-hourly (5-minute) values of air temperature recorded at the station during the aggregation period selected by the user. It is based on measurements made at the station, typically at about 1.5 metres above the ground surface. This parameter has units of Kelvin (K). Temperature measured in Kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (°C) by subtracting 273.15. Two error estimates are provided in addition, to help users take into account uncertainties."

It includes all forms of precipitation (rain and snow). This parameter is accumulated over the aggregation period selected by the user. The units of this parameter are depth in millimetre of water equivalent. Care should be taken when comparing such observations with model or reanalysis parameters, because observations are by definition local to a particular point in space, rather than representing averages over a large geographical area."
