        description: This parameter is the accumulated precipitation that was measured as having reached the Earth's surface at the station. It includes all forms of precipitation (rain and snow). This parameter is accumulated over the aggregation period selected by the user. The units of this parameter are depth in millimetre of water equivalent. Care should be taken when comparing such observations with model or reanalysis parameters, because observations are by definition local to a particular point in space, rather than representing averages over a large geographical area.

The first element (two letters) indicates the State, the second element indicates the nearest city, and the last two elements describe a vector from the city to the station. The distance is given in statute miles (1 statute mile = 1609.344 metres) and the bearing is given in the 16-element compass rose. For example, station "VA_Charlottesville_2_SSE" refers to a station located 2 miles South-South-East of Charlottesville, Virginia.

        description: This parameter is the ratio of the amount of atmospheric moisture present in the air relative to the amount that would be present if the air were saturated with respect to water or ice. This ratio is multiplied by 100 to provide numbers in percent (%). The measurements are taken at a height of 2 metres above the ground surface. The instrument is a capacitive thin-film device. It measures the flow of electricity across two electrodes separated by a polymer film. The capacitance of the film is converted to relative humidity by a calibration equation. The values are averaged over 5-minute periods, obtained by selecting "sub-hourly" aggregation period. Other aggregation periods ("hourly", "daily") are also available, in which case the results are based on further averages of the 5-minute data. A quality flag is also available for this variable.

      accumulated_precipitation:
        description: This parameter is the accumulated precipitation that was measured as having reached the Earth's surface at the station. It includes all forms of precipitation (rain and snow). This parameter is accumulated over the aggregation period selected by the user. The units of this parameter are depth in millimetre of water equivalent. Care should be taken when comparing such observations with model or reanalysis parameters, because observations are by definition local to a particular point in space, rather than representing averages over a large geographical area.

Temperature measured in Kelvin can be converted to degrees Celsius (Â°C) by subtracting 273.15. Several error estimates are provided in addition, to help users take into account uncertainties."

The distance is given in statute miles (1 statute mile = 1609.344 metres) and the bearing is given in the 16-element compass rose.

      relative_humidity:
        description: This parameter is the ratio of the amount of atmospheric moisture present in the air relative to the amount that would be present if the air were saturated with respect to water or ice. This ratio is multiplied by 100 to provide numbers in percent (%). The measurements are taken at a height of 2 metres above the ground surface. The instrument is a capacitive thin-film device. It measures the flow of electricity across two electrodes separated by a polymer film. The capacitance of the film is converted to relative humidity by a calibration equation. The values are averaged over 5-minute periods, obtained by selecting "sub-hourly" aggregation period. Other aggregation periods ("hourly", "daily") are also available, in which case the results are based on further averages of the 5-minute data. A quality flag is also available for this variable.

The quantity applies outside the atmosphere, by default at a distance of one astronomical unit from the sun, but a coordinate or scalar coordinate variable of distance_from_sun can be used to specify a value other than the default. "Irradiance" means the power per unit area (called radiative flux in other standard names), the area being normal to the direction of flow of the radiant energy.
